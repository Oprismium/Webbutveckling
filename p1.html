                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>
                    Sweden emerged from the Norse world during the Viking Age, shaped by trade, warfare, and the slow consolidation of royal power.
                </p>

                <h2>The Medieval Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    Christianity, law codes, and monarchy bound the land into a realm, culminating in the Kalmar Union and centuries of struggle for independence.
                </p>

                <h2>The Swedish Empire</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 17th century, Sweden rose as a great power under kings like Gustavus Adolphus, dominating the Baltic through discipline and fire.
                </p>

                <h2>Modern Sweden</h2>
                <p>
                    Defeat, reform, and neutrality reshaped Sweden into a constitutional monarchy known today for stability, industry, and diplomacy.
